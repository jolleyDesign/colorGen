# colorGen
Random color generator, with GUI display.

## Random color generator

Generates a random RGB value, converts it to a HEX value, then creates a tkinter window to display the color.

I'm sure a thousand projects just like this exist, but this is mine!

### Update 0.2
- Added button to choose a new color, making it easier to refresh the GUI.
- Made the HEX value selectable and copyable.
